# Smoothie Recipe App

A simple yet efficient smoothie recipe app where you can view, add, update, and delete smoothie recipes with ease. This app has been built as a personal project to bolster my skills and experience with Supabase and React, specifically in the use of react router, useParams, and useNavigate. The project was created following NetNinja's Supabase tutorial, which can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydz7Dj5QHKY&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9hUb6sHthUEwG7r9VDPBMKO).

## Features

- View all smoothie recipes
- Add new smoothie recipes
- Update existing smoothie recipes
- Delete smoothie recipes

## Future Plans

- Implement User Authentication and Authorization
- Convert the current JavaScript codebase to TypeScript

## Technologies Used

- Supabase
- React
  - React Router
  - useParams
  - useNavigate

**How to run the starter project:**

1. Once downloaded, navigate to the project directory in a terminal and run **npm install** to install all the project dependencies.
2. In the project directory, run **npm start** to run the app & view it in a browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
